# Chemical-Reaction-Engineering
Solution to selected problems of the Elements of Chemical Reactions Engineering, 5ed.
The solutions are slightly different from the Official Solution Manual. 
I added several notes on each exercise and corrections to each exercise and make them more interactive via widgets. 

Note: all solutions were developed in Python on a Jupyter Notebook to make it easier to read.
1. Exercise 1.2. Smog in the LA Basin
